# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Local testing

- Clone repo into a local file
- run 'npm run dev'
- go to http://localhost:5173

* Note this application does not have a backend and will reset on refresh \*

# Fast React Pizza

This application focuses on advanced React Router work and utilizing Redux, styling is done completely with Tailwind CSS inline styling classes.

This is a basic application that doesn't require any user account but allows a user to enter thier name choose pizzas, adjust quantities, place an order, and modify that order if desired.
